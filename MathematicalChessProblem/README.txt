# Algorythm to solve the problem, are all squares attacked? with 5 queens palced on a chess board of size n

Cycle passing through all permutations, size = boardSize^2, throught all of the combinations and rearranges 5 objects (queens)
P(n,r)=(n!)/((n-r)!)
Here P = number of permutations, n = the size of the board, r = number of objects (queens we need to permutate)

I'm not sure if it's possible to use the better algorithm in such situations without using nested ifs, ChatGPT suggested to us nested for's but the problem remains the same.
